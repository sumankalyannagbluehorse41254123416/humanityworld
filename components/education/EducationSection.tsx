                While there has been a consistent increase in both male and
                female literacy rates over the years, a significant gender gap
                remains prevalent. Notably, India harbors the highest population
                of illiterate individuals globally, with the percentage standing
                at 25%. Therefore, our focus will be on offering support and
                motivation to schools and individuals across all rural areas in
                India. Our aim is to elevate the literacy rate and reduce the
                gender gap by providing essential assistance and resources to
                enhance educational opportunities.
