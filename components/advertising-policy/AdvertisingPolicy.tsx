                Advertising keeps Humanity World Foundation and many of the
                websites and services you use free of charge. We work hard to
                make sure that ads are safe, unobtrusive, and as relevant as
                possible. For example, you won’t see pop-up ads on Humanity World
                Foundation, and we terminate the accounts of hundreds of
                thousands of publishers and advertisers that violate our
                policies each year – including ads containing malware, ads for
                counterfeit goods, or ads that attempt to misuse your personal
                information.
