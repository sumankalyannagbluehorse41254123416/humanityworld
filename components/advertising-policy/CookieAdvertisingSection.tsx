                <h2>How Humanity World Foundation Uses Cookies in Advertising</h2>
              </div>

              <p>
                Cookies help to make advertising more effective. Without cookies, it’s
                harder for an advertiser to reach its audience, or to know how many
                ads were shown and how many clicks they received.
              </p>

              <p>
                Many websites, such as news sites and blogs, partner with Humanity World
                Foundation to show ads to their visitors. Working with our partners,
                we may use cookies for a number of purposes, such as to stop you from
                seeing the same ad over and over again, to detect and stop click fraud,
                and to show ads that are likely to be more relevant (such as ads based
                on websites you have visited).
              </p>

              <p>
                We store a record of the ads we serve in our logs. These server logs
                typically include your web request, IP address, browser type, browser
                language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies
                that may uniquely identify your browser. We store this data for a number
                of reasons, the most important of which are to improve our services and
                to maintain the security of our systems.
