                <p>Many decisions are made to determine which ad you see.</p>

              <li>
                <p>
                  Sometimes the ad you see is based on your current or past location. 
                  Your IP address is usually a good indication of your approximate 
                  location. So, you might see an ad on the homepage of Humanity 
                  World Foundation that promotes a forthcoming donation or Humanity 
                  event in your location.
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>
                  Sometimes you might also see an ad on the web that’s based on your 
                  app activity or activity on Humanity World Foundation services; 
                  an in-app ad that’s based on your web activity; or an ad based on 
                  your activity on another device.
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>
                  Sometimes the ad you see on a page is served by Humanity World 
                  Foundation but selected by another company. For example, you might 
                  have registered with a newspaper website. From information you’ve given 
                  the newspaper, it can make decisions about which ads to show you, and 
                  it can use Humanity World Foundation’s ad serving products to deliver 
                  those ads.
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>
                  You may also see ads on Humanity World Foundation services based on 
                  information, such as your email address, that you provided to 
                  advertisers and the advertisers then shared with Humanity World 
                  Foundation.
                </p>

              <li>
                <p>
                  We do have restrictions on this type of ad. For example, we prohibit 
                  advertisers from selecting an audience based on sensitive information, 
                  such as health information, nudity, intimate ads or religious beliefs.
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>
                  If you find any such advertisement objectionable you can report the 
                  advertisement for restricting future broadcast or directly close it 
                  by clicking the cross at the extreme top corner on the right side of 
                  the advertisement.
