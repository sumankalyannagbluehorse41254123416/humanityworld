                Humanity World Foundation’s advertising systems may use other technologies,
                including Flash and HTML5, for functions like display of interactive ad
                formats. We may use the IP address, for example, to identify your general
                location. We may also select advertising based on information about your
                computer or device, such as your device model, browser type, or sensors
                in your device like the accelerometer.
