                Humanity World Foundation’s ad products may receive or infer information
                about your location from a variety of sources. For example, we may use the
                IP address to identify your general location; we may receive precise
                location from your mobile device; we may infer your location from your
                search queries; and websites or apps that you use may send information
                about your location to us. Humanity World Foundation uses location
                information in our ads products to infer demographic information, to
                improve the relevance of the ads you see, to measure ad performance and to
                report aggregate statistics to advertisers.
