                To serve ads in services where cookie technology may not be available
                (for example, in mobile applications), we may use technologies that
                perform similar functions to cookies. Sometimes Humanity World
                Foundation links the identifier used for advertising on mobile
                applications to an advertising cookie on the same device in order to
                coordinate ads across your mobile apps and mobile browser. This can
                happen, for example, when you see an ad within an app that launches a
                web page in your mobile browser. This also helps us improve the
                reports we give to our advertisers on the effectiveness of their
                campaigns.
