                We are committed to safeguarding your personal information and have implemented
                reasonable security measures to protect it from unauthorized access, disclosure,
                alteration, or destruction. Our security measures include but are not limited to:
              </h6>

              <ul className="data_list">
                <li>Access Control:</li>
                <p>
                  We restrict access to your personal information to authorized personnel who have a
                  legitimate need to access it for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. Our
                  staff is trained on data protection and privacy best practices.
                </p>

                <li>Firewalls and Intrusion Detection:</li>
                <p>
                  We employ advanced firewall and intrusion detection systems to protect our servers
                  and network infrastructure from unauthorized access and malicious activities.
                </p>

                <li>Data Retention:</li>
                <p>
                  We retain your personal information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the
                  purposes for which it was collected or as required by applicable laws and
                  regulations. When we no longer need your information, we securely dispose of it.
                </p>

                <li>Incident Response Plan:</li>
                <p>
                  In the unlikely event of a data breach or security incident, we have an incident
                  response plan in place to promptly identify, mitigate, and report the breach, as
                  required by applicable laws and regulations. We will also notify you and relevant
                  authorities, if necessary, in accordance with legal requirements.
                </p>
              </ul>

              <p>
                While we take all reasonable steps to protect your personal information, it's
                important to acknowledge that no method of data transmission or storage is entirely
                secure. Therefore, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot
                guarantee its absolute security. By using our website and providing us with your
                information, you acknowledge and accept the inherent risks associated with data
                transmission over the internet.
              </p>

              <p>
                We continuously review and update our security measures to stay current with
                emerging threats and best practices to ensure the ongoing protection of your personal
                information.
