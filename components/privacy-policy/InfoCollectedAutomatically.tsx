                Like other online companies, we receive technical information
                when you use our services. We use these technologies to analyse
                how people use the service, to improve how our Website
                functions, to save your log-in information for future sessions,
                and to serve you with advertisements that may interest you.
              </p>

              <p>
                We and our third-party service providers, including analytics,
                may automatically collect certain information from you whenever
                you access or interact with the Service. This information may
                include, among other information, the browser and operating
                system you are using, the URL or advertisement that referred you
                to the service, the search terms you entered into a search
                engine that led you to the service, areas within the service
                that you visited, which links you clicked on, which pages or
                content you viewed and for how long, other similar information
                and statistics about your interactions, such download errors and
                length of visits to certain pages and other information commonly
                shared when browsers communicate with websites. We may combine
                this automatically collected log information with other
                information we collect about you. We do this to improve services
                we offer you, and to improve marketing, analytics, and site
                functionality.
