                  We use cookies to help us show ads and to make recommendations for Services
                  and other organizations to people who may be interested in the services, or
                  causes they promote.

                  For example, Cookies allow us to help deliver ads to people who have
                  previously visited a Humanity World Foundation’s website, purchased its
                  services, or used its apps and to recommend services and services based on
                  that activity. Cookies also allow us to limit the number of times that you
                  see an ad so you don't see the same ad over and over again.
                </li>

                <li>
                  We also use cookies to help measure the performance of ad campaigns for
                  Businesses that use the Humanity World Foundation Services.
                </li>

                <li>
                  For example, we use cookies to count the number of times that an ad is shown
                  and to calculate the cost of those ads. We also use cookies to measure how
                  often people do things such as click on or view ads.
                </li>

                <li>Cookies help us serve and measure ads across different browsers and devices used by the same person.</li>

                <li>
                  For example, we can use cookies to prevent you from seeing the same ad over
                  and over again across the different devices that you use.
                </li>

                <li>
                  We also use cookies to help you opt out of seeing ads from Humanity World
                  Foundation based on your activity on third-party websites. Learn more about
                  the information we receive, how we decide which ads to show you on and off

                  to you.
