                  For example, Cookies can help us identify and impose additional security
                  measures when someone may be attempting to access a Humanity World
                  Foundation account without authorization, for instance, by rapidly guessing
                  different passwords. We also use cookies to store information that allows
                  us to recover your account in the event that you forget your password or to
                  require additional authentication if you tell us that your account has been

                  to identify computers that are used to create large numbers of fake
                  Humanity World Foundation accounts. We also use cookies to detect computers
                  infected with malware and to take steps to prevent them from causing further
                  harm. Cookies also help us prevent underage people from registering for
                  Humanity World Foundation accounts.
