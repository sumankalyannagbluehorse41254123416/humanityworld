                Numerous women are currently uninformed about the significance of hygiene and lack essential 
                knowledge regarding their menstrual cycles. Moreover, they are deprived of access to necessary 
                sanitary pads. To address this critical issue, the HWF team will embark on a journey across 
                Maharashtra, initiating awareness programs and campaigns tailored to women's menstrual health 
                and hygiene. Additionally, we are committed to distributing sanitary pads free of charge 
                throughout the state, striving to make a meaningful impact on the lives of these women.
